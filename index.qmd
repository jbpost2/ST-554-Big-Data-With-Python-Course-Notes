title: "Analysis of Big Data"
---

Welcome to ST 554 - Analysis of Big Data (with `python`)

In this course we'll look at common issues, analysis, and software used with big data. We'll discuss the major aspects with the commonly cited '5 V's of Big Data':

Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity (Variability), and Value

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("01_Programming_in_python/img/big-data-characteristics.png")
```

The course is split into four topics

1.  Programming in `python`
2.  Big Data Management
3.  Modeling Big Data (with `Spark` via `pyspark`)
4.  Streaming Data

Using `python` as our programming language we'll learn about using Jupyter notebooks to share and document our work. We'll use `pyspark` as our interface to the `Spark` software, which is commonly used to handle big data.

## Course Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course students will be able to

-   explain the steps and purpose of `python` programs (CO 1)
-   efficiently read in, combine, and manipulate data in python (CO 2)
-   utilize help and other resources to customize programs (CO 3)
-   write programs using good programming practices (CO 4)
-   explore, manage, and solve common common problems with big data (CO 5)

## Weekly To-do List

Generally speaking, each week will have a few videos to watch and readings to do as well as corresponding homework assignments (see the syllabus on Moodle for homework policies).

-   There will be two exams and the exam windows (days when you can take the exams) are available on the syllabus and course schedule.
-   There will be three projects, the third of which will count as the final for the course. These will require a reasonably substantial time commitment.

## Getting Help!

To obtain course help there are a number of options:

-   Discussion Forum on Moodle - This should be used for any question you feel comfortable asking and having others view. The TA, other students, and I will answer questions on this board. This will be the fastest way to receive a response!\
-   E-mail - If there is a question that you don't feel comfortable asking the whole class you can use e-mail. The TA and I will be checking daily (during the regular work week).
-   Zoom Office Hour Sessions - These sessions can be used to share screens and have multiple users. You can do text chat, voice, and video. They are great for a class like this!
